# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of exploratory data analysis techniques to extract meaningful insights from a dataset. The analysis is performed using a Jupyter Notebook, combining data manipulation, visualization, and statistical exploration.

## Features

- **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Initial exploration of the dataset, handling missing values, and fixing data inconsistencies.
- **Statistical Summary**: Calculation of descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.).
- **Data Visualization**: Generation of plots (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, box plots) for understanding data distributions and relationships.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Investigation of relationships between variables.
- **Key Findings**: Highlights and insights derived from the analysis.

## Prerequisites

To run this notebook, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- The following Python libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `scipy` (optional, if advanced statistical tests are included)

You can install the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy
```
## How to Use
- Clone the repository or download the notebook file.
- Open the notebook in VS Code or any preferred IDE.
- Open the **EDA.ipynb** file.
- Run each cell sequentially to perform the analysis.

## Dataset
- **Name**: data.csv
- **Description**:  This dataset contains clinical and genomic data for patients with breast cancer. The dataset includes four types of breast cancer.

## Results
The results are documented in the notebook as inline comments and visualizations. For further analysis or reporting, you can export the figures and data summaries.
